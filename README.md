## Hour of Code


## Three Keys
As a challenge, I was given 2 days to create an original game, complete with art and a full gameplay loop. I created Three Keys, a game that challenges the Player to find three keys to unlock a door and safely escape the level, all without getting caught by three enemy AI. Players take control of a third person character (using WASD and a mouse for movement) and have to search through the level to find the three golden keys to open the golden door. The game is complete with a menu, game over, and victory screens, all giving the player an option to restart the game or quit. The game starts with the player placed in the room and the three enemy AI patrolling various areas. The AI will chase the player when in sight and will explode and cause damage when caught. If the player is damaged by all three AI, their health will be depleted (Health bar will reflect damage) and the game will end. If player finds and collects all three golden keys, they will be allowed to unlock the golden door (just by colliding with the door) and the game will end in a victory.
